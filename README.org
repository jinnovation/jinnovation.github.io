* About Me

  I'm a machine learning engineer working on ML platform and infrastructure at
  [[https://engineering.atspotify.com/][Spotify]] in NYC. I currently lead initiatives centered around
  developer-friendly AI/ML governance that empower ML practitioners to innovate
  responsibly and cost-effectively. I've also worked on scalable cloud-native
  infrastructure for production-tier machine learning workloads based on Ray,
  Kubeflow, and Kubernetes.

  Before Spotify, I helped build machine learning platforms at [[https://nvidia.com][NVIDIA]] as a
  member of their [[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/][autonomous vehicles division]] and Twitter as a member of their
  [[https://cortex.twitter.com][Cortex]] organization. I've also worked on site reliability and observability
  infrastructure at Uber.

  I'm a proud alumnus of the [[https://www.uchicago.edu/][University of Chicago]], where I studied computer
  science and economics.

* About Me

  I'm a machine learning engineer with a specialization in platform and
  infrastructure. I am currently a Staff ML Engineer at [[https://hinge.co/][Hinge]] scaling platform
  and infrastructure for ML and generative AI.

  I have previously helped build and scale machine learning platform and
  infrastructure at Spotify, NVIDIA, and Twitter (pre-X). I have also acted as
  Engineering Advisor for the non-profit [[https://www.humane-intelligence.org/][Humane Intelligence]], where I worked
  with [[https://www.rummanchowdhury.com/][Dr. Rumman Chowdhury]] to build a community of practice around the
  burgeoning field of algorithmic audit and evaluation in service of responsible
  AI.

  I've also worked on site reliability and observability infrastructure at Uber,
  contributing to the systems that ultimately led to the creation of [[https://m3db.io/][M3DB]] and
  [[https://chronosphere.io/][Chronosphere]].

  I'm a +mildly traumatized+ proud alumnus of the [[https://www.uchicago.edu/][University of Chicago]], where I
  studied computer science and economics.

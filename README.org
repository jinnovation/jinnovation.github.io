* About Me

  I'm a machine learning engineer with a specialization in platform and
  infrastructure.

  Most recently, I was a senior member of [[https://engineering.atspotify.com/][Spotify]]'s ML Platform org. There, I
  worked on:

  - Compute orchestration and workload management, e.g. managed multi-tenant
    cluster infrastructure for [[https://www.kubeflow.org/][Kubeflow]] and [[https://www.ray.io/][Ray]] via Kubernetes in Google Cloud;
  - Developer-friendly AI/ML governance and artifact/experiment management with
    [[https://backstage.io/][Backstage]] and [[https://mlflow.org/][MLflow]].

  Before Spotify, I helped build machine learning platforms at [[https://nvidia.com][NVIDIA]] as a
  member of their [[https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/][autonomous vehicles division]] and Twitter as a member of their
  [[http://archive.today/SAbMp][Cortex]] organization. I've also worked on site reliability and observability
  infrastructure at Uber.

  I'm a proud alumnus of the [[https://www.uchicago.edu/][University of Chicago]], where I studied computer
  science and economics.

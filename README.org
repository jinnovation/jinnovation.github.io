* Summary

  I am a NYC-based software engineer, currently working on machine learning
  platform and infrastructure at [[https://engineering.atspotify.com/][Spotify]]. Previously, I've worked on AI
  infrastructure for autonomous vehicle R&D at [[https://nvidia.com][NVIDIA]], as well as at [[https://cortex.twitter.com][Twitter
  Cortex]] on machine learning platform and infrastructure.

  I specialize in large-scale, high-performance production machine learning
  platforms to support the full machine learning lifecycle -- experimentation,
  verification, productionization, etc.

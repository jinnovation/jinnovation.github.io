I am a NYC-based software engineer. I&rsquo;m currently at <a href="https://www.uber.com">Uber</a> as a member of
Observability Applications.
</p>

<p>
My resume can be found <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>.

<h2 id="org11f0845">Professional Interests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org11f0845">
<p>
I&rsquo;m interested in <b>research engineering</b> and <b>machine learning infrastructure
engineering</b> positions.
</p>

<p>
More broadly, I&rsquo;m especially interested in opportunities that operate at the
intersection of <b>research</b> and <b>engineering</b>. To that end, the roles that
most excite me provide opportunities to explore my interests in AI/ML; how
they might be implemented or productized both scalably and performantly; and
bring those research and modelling findings into production.
</p>

<p>
If you and your team are working on projects that I&rsquo;d make a good addition
for, let&rsquo;s talk.

<h2 id="org1aef336">Research Interests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1aef336">
<p>
My research interests lie in the fields of <b>machine learning</b>, <b>knowledge
representation</b>, and <b>decision theory</b>.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, I am drawn to the following questions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is <b>knowledge</b>? What does it mean to <b>know</b> something? Can a machine
that achieves near-human performance at some task be said to truly <b>know</b>
and <b>understand</b> that task beyond a behavioristic interpretation thereof?</li>

<li>How do we <b>model</b> and <b>represent</b> that knowledge to achieve precision,
recall, and performance on par with &#x2013; possibly even beyond &#x2013; humans?</li>

<li>Traditional machines reason with &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; logic &#x2013; conditionals,
pattern-matching, etc. How can we, as engineers, design and implement
systems that can reason about <b>ambiguity</b> and <b>uncertainty</b>?</li>
</ul>

My major project of early 2018 revolved around overhauling Observability
Anomaly Detection&rsquo;s forecasting workflow to allow for performant forecast
backfilling. In this article, I discuss the product-centric motivations for
doing so, outline the primary performance bottlenecks, and discuss the design
that the team decided to base our solution &#x2013; and all subsequent
optimizations &#x2013; around.

<p>
One of my first sizeable projects at Uber Observability was implementing
support for multiple forecasting models in our anomaly detection pipeline. The
pre-existing architecture was built around a single-model assumption that
stored forecasting results in a single, top-level mapping; this data model
made it cumbersome to add in support for new forecasting models later down the
line, as our team attempted to do shortly after I joined.

<p>
In this article, I give a brief overview of anomaly detection within Uber&rsquo;s
Observability stack; detail the thought process that went into my design for a
&ldquo;model-agnostic&rdquo; data model to extend the pre-existing one; as well as the
resulting rollout strategy.

  text="""
  I am a NYC-based software engineer, currently working on AI infrastructure for
  autonomous vehicle development at NVIDIA. Previous, I was a member of
  <a href="http://cortex.twitter.com">Twitter Cortex</a> and the Machine Learning
  Platform Tools team.

[[params.introduction.paragraph]]
  text="""
  I'm interested in building large-scale, high-performance production machine
  learning systems for compelling use cases -- particularly those with stringent
  requirements around scalability, traceability, and verifiability. More
  broadly, I'm particularly interested in opportunities to explore the
  intersection of machine learning theory and engineering.

I've written about my work in the past. Here's a representative sample.

* [[http://eng.uber.com/anomaly-detection/][Implementing Model-Agnosticism in Uberâ€™s Real-Time Anomaly Detection Platform]]

  One of my first sizeable projects at Uber Observability was implementing
  support for multiple forecasting models in our anomaly detection pipeline. The
  pre-existing architecture was built around a single-model assumption that
  stored forecasting results in a single, top-level mapping; this data model
  made it cumbersome to add in support for new forecasting models later down the
  line, as our team attempted to do shortly after I joined.

  In this article, I give a brief overview of anomaly detection within Uber's
  Observability stack; detail the thought process that went into my design for a
  "model-agnostic" data model to extend the pre-existing one; as well as the
  resulting rollout strategy.
